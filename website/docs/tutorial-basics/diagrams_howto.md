# Notation primer

**Graffoo**, a Graphical Framework for OWL Ontologies, is an open source tool that can be used to present the classes, properties and restrictions within OWL ontologies, or sub-sections of them, as clear and easy-to-understand diagrams. In sum, yellow rounded boxes denote *classes*, blue and green arrows are *object* and *datatype properties* respectively, purple circles denote *individuals*, and green polygons are *datatypes*.
