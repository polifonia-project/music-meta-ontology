# Music Meta Ontology

The Music Meta module provides a rich and flexible ontology to describe music
metadata related to artists, compositions, performances, recordings,
casts, and links. Music Meta focuses on provenance and interoperability â€“ 
essential requirements for the integration of music datasets, which is currently
hampered by the specificity of existent ontologies. The model is based on the
Information-Realisation ODP, allowing to reduce complexity of FRBR-based
models, whose application in the music domain has raised concerns.
To enable data integration from existing knowledge bases and datasets, we also
align Meta to Music Ontology, DOREMUS, and Wikidata. To facil- itate
the reuse of Music Meta and its data conversion into OWL/RDF Knowl- edge Graphs,
we developed a library to map arbitrary music metadata into RDF triples. This
enables a practical and scalable workflow for data lifting to create Music
Knowledge Graphs without expert knowledge of our ontological model.
