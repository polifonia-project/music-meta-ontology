The Music Ontology defines the following sub-concepts of a MusicalExpression, which should be used instead of MusicalExpression itself: Score (the result of an arrangement), Sound (produced during a performance), Signal. However, it is possible to stick to FRBR and bypass the worflow mechanism this ontology defines by using the core FRBR properties on such objects.

From the FRBR final report: The entity defined as item is a concrete entity. It is in many instances a single physical object (e.g., a copy of a one-volume monograph, a single audio cassette, etc.). There are instances, however, where the entity defined as item comprises more than one physical object (e.g., a monograph issued as two separately bound volumes, a recording issued on three separate compact discs, etc.).  In terms of intellectual content and physical form, an item exemplifying a manifestation is normally the same as the manifestation itself. However, variations may occur from one item to another, even when the items exemplify the same manifestation, where those variations are the result of actions external to the intent of the producer of the manifestation (e.g., damage occurring after the item was produced, binding performed by a library, etc.).",http://purl.org/ontology/mo/MusicalItem,MusicalItem,unstable,,encodes,,Medium,,,,
MusicalManifestation,class,"This entity is related to the edition/production/publication of a musical expression (musical manifestation are closely related with the music industry (their terms, concepts, definitions, methods (production, publication, etc.), etc.)      From the FRBR final report: The entity defined as manifestation encompasses a wide range of materials, including manuscripts, books, periodicals, maps, posters, sound recordings, films, video recordings, CD-ROMs, multimedia kits, etc. As an entity, manifestation represents all the physical objects that bear the same characteristics, in respect to both intellectual content and physical form.   Work #1 J. S. Bach's Six suites for unaccompanied cello      * Expression #1 sound issued during the performance by Janos Starker recorded in 1963 and 1965           o Manifestation #1 recordings released on 33 1/3 rpm sound discs in 1965 by Mercury           o Manifestation #2 recordings re-released on compact disc in 1991 by Mercury      * Expression #2 sound issued during the performances by Yo-Yo Ma recorded in 1983           o Manifestation #1 recordings released on 33 1/3 rpm sound discs in 1983 by CBS Records           o Manifestation #2 recordings re-released on compact disc in 1992 by CBS Records              Changes that occur deliberately or even inadvertently in the production process that affect the copies result, strictly speaking, in a new manifestation. A manifestation resulting from such a change may be identified as a particular ""state"" or ""issue"" of the publication.  Changes that occur to an individual copy after the production process is complete (e.g., the loss of a page, rebinding, etc.) are not considered to result in a new manifestation. That copy is simply considered to be an exemplar (or item) of the manifestation that deviates from the copy as produced.  With the entity defined as manifestation we can describe the physical characteristics of a set of items and the characteristics associated with the production and distribution of that set of items that may be important factors in enabling users to choose a manifestation appropriate to their physical needs and constraints, and to identify and acquire a copy of that manifestation.  Defining manifestation as an entity also enables us to draw relationships between specific manifestations of a work.
